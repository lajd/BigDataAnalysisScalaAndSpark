/**
 * This class implements a munit test suite for the methods in object
 * `Lists` that need to be implemented as part of this assignment. A test
 * suite is simply a collection of individual tests for some specific
 * component of a program.
 *
 * To run this test suite, start "sbt" then run the "test" command.

  /**
   * Tests are written using the `test("description") { ... }` syntax
   * The most common way to implement a test body is using the method `assert`
   * which tests that its argument evaluates to `true`. So one of the simplest
   * successful tests is the following:
   */
  test("one plus one is two (0pts)") {
    assert(1 + 1 == 2)

    assert(1 + 2 == 3)

  /**
   * One problem with the previous (failing) test is that munit will
   * only tell you that a test failed, but it will not tell you what was
   * the reason for the failure. The output looks like this:
   *
   * {{{
   * ==> X example.ListSuite.one plus one is three (0pts)?  0.007s munit.FailException: /tmp/example/src/test/scala/example/ListSuite.scala:26 assertion failed
   * 25:  test("one plus one is two (0pts)") {
   * 26:      assert(1 + 1 == 3)
   * 27:  }
   * }}}
   *
   * This situation can be improved by using a assertEquals
   * (this is only possible in munit). So if you
   * run the next test, munit will show the following output:
   *
   * {{{
   * ==> X example.ListSuite.details why one plus one is not three (0pts)  0.006s munit.FailException: /tmp/example/src/test/scala/example/ListSuite.scala:72
   * 71:  test("details why one plus one is not three (0pts)") {
   * 72:      assertEquals(1 + 1, 3) // Fix me, please!
   * 73:  }
   * values are not the same
   * => Obtained
   * 3
   * => Diff (- obtained, + expected)
   * -3
   * +2
   * }}}
   *
   * We recommend to always use the assertEquals equality operator
   * when writing tests.
